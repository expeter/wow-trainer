# Delivery milestones

This is the maintained grouping of open tickets. Individual requirements and
status remain authoritative in [`README.md`](README.md); stable behavior lives
in [`specifications.md`](specifications.md).

## Current release boundary

- No standalone Midnight Season 2 release has been cut and no public deployment
  is configured. The repository starts from the tagged L'ura v0.9.1 source
  baseline solely for incremental extraction.
- The inherited L'ura leaderboard remains `season-1` and is owned by the legacy
  repository. This repository does not change, migrate, or deploy it.

## Midnight Season 2 transition

Goal: preserve the reviewed L’ura trainer platform knowledge while moving new
encounter development into an independently deployed Season 2 repository.

- `CR-229` — completed the privacy-safe migration dossier under
  [`handover/midnight-season-2`](../handover/midnight-season-2/00-README.md),
  including the reuse audit, separate Learn 2D and Train 3D contracts,
  isolated encounter packages, Sentinels reference, API `/v2` statistics
  boundary, verification strategy, source material, and new-session prompt.
- `CR-230` — completed: establish the standalone product identity, default
  Season 2 shell, development-only L'ura reference, documentation set,
  dependency baseline, and hard deployment safeguards.
- `CR-231` — completed: pin and verify the reviewed Vite 8.2.1, Vitest
  4.1.10, and Playwright 1.62.1 bootstrap toolchain through `sec-helper`, with
  a native-loader-compatible Vite configuration.
- `CR-232` — completed: add and start the localhost-only global Project Inbox
  skill, with captures routed into the maintained Season 2 ticket workflow.
- `CR-233` — completed: acknowledge the original L’ura Trainer in repository
  documentation only, never as a deployed Midnight shell link.
- `SPEC-018` — completed: make the shared-shell/separate-runtime and isolated
  auto-discovered encounter-package boundaries binding.
- `FR-072` — in progress now that `CR-230` and `SPEC-018` are stable: Stage 4A
  introduced `EncounterPackageV1`, conformance validation, lazy automatic
  discovery, and the isolated Entombed Sentinels package. Stage 4B makes the
  focused Helical Toxins lesson playable through separate package-owned Learn
  2D and Train 3D runtimes, with shell-owned persisted movement bindings and
  HUD preferences. Full-fight, Mythic, plan-image, and scoring work remains.
- `FR-073` — deferred: API `/v2`, public statistics, achievements, and rankings.
- `CR-235` — deferred until the first trainable Sentinels release candidate:
  remove L’ura and Season 1 runtime, service, deployment, asset, storage, test,
  and branding residue from the active product while preserving the immutable
  baseline tag, privacy-safe history, handover evidence, and README lineage.
- `CR-236` — deferred until the legacy-retirement pass: give the retained shell
  a restrained token-driven troll, nature, venom, and spirit-realm palette while
  preserving its structure, accessibility, responsiveness, and semantics.
- `FR-074` — deferred until the trainable Sentinels release candidate and both
  pre-publication cleanup passes are accepted:
  enable an isolated GitHub Pages workflow and `midnight.asgard.website` with
  an explicit production gate and legacy-domain safety checks.
- `CR-234` — deferred until the first static publication: perform a measured
  bundle, runtime, accessibility, responsive, and test-duration optimization
  pass without changing encounter mechanics.
- `FR-075` — deferred until Sentinels and the optimization pass are stable:
  open individually ticketed, isolated encounter packages one boss at a time.

The near-term execution order is `FR-072` → `CR-235` → `CR-236` → `FR-074` →
`CR-234` → `FR-075`.
`FR-073` remains a separate later online-platform milestone and does not block
the static trainer sequence.

No other boss work may start alongside Entombed Sentinels. The L'ura API and
leaderboard remain frozen legacy reference behavior and cannot deploy from this
repository.

The remaining milestones below are the frozen L'ura v0.9.1 delivery record.
They are retained for source archaeology, not as the Season 2 execution order.

## M0 · Online identity hotfix

Goal: ensure a run that starts authenticated remains attributable and that the
shell never silently mistakes an expired server session for a valid login.

- `BUG-145` — revalidate before issuance, bind the full run and its wipes to
  the issued attempt capability, reject stale-session anonymous downgrades, and
  align API/client version acceptance at `0.6.2`.
- `CR-194` — open public Recent activity identities in their trainer profile
  instead of navigating directly to Raider.IO.
- `BUG-148` — show whether the next pull is a verified attempt, deliberately
  anonymous, or local because the signed-in account lacks an active character.
- `CR-196` — show the played raid-plan name and selected verified Battle.net
  character together on the controlled-player nameplate without implying
  attribution when no active character is selected.
- `BUG-149` — keep a transition-started Phase 2 crystal grounded throughout
  the beam/orb event, matching direct entry and every difficulty.

This patch retains `season-1`: it repairs attribution and version acceptance
without changing encounter scoring or ranking order.

- `CR-226` — publish v0.9.1 with synchronized frontend/API compatibility and
  verify production leaderboard continuity while retaining `season-1`.

## M1 · Encounter completion

Goal: finish the remaining encounter mechanics and reconcile the NPC strategy,
visual state, collision, scoring, and accepted-run rules.

This is the next implementation milestone and today's priority.

### Phase 2 and Phase 3

Implement in dependency order:

1. `FR-048` — drop and recover the landing trio's crystal, then make the
   crystal carrier and one helper cover one opening Soak while the controlled
   player resolves the other.
2. `CR-051` — swap the second Phase 3 sequence's ground Soak and memory-game
   order after the exact overlap timing is confirmed.

Implemented for localhost review in this milestone:

- `CR-198` — every ordinary dropped crystal now follows the global one-second
  pickup and six-second explosion lifecycle, with only a correctly committed
  P3 protection crystal exempt.
- `FR-050` — four random non-crystal beam assignees now intercept four
  continuously orbiting unresolved orbs per set, with rendered player aim and
  a terminal miss rule.
- `FR-049` — the final Phase 2 regroup now uses configured personal circles,
  and each visible actor position becomes that actor's Phase 3 flight origin.

### Phase 4 roles

Completed in this milestone:

- `BUG-150` — the NPC tank now holds the rendered group position throughout an
  active three-Starsplinter set and resumes its frontal route afterward.
- `FR-068` — two explicit shared tank assignments drive the localhost P1/P2/P3
  Heaven's Lance mitigation/swap loop. This incorporates the playable-cone
  foundation previously tracked separately by `FR-022`; `CR-195` finalizes
  which configured tank owns each Phase 4 role.
- `FR-023` — superseded by deterministic two-tank ownership under `CR-195`.
- `CR-195` — on localhost, Tank 1 owns the frontal cone, Tank 2 owns the moving rendered
  protection zone, neither receives Starsplinter, and each controlled role has
  its own canonical achievement.
- `BUG-152` — public hosts retain the released pre-tank behavior while the
  complete tank-role implementation remains available for local validation.
- `CR-197` — full-journey achievements now require Phase 1 through Phase 4 and
  cumulative/multi-run badges display their saved progress.

All current M1 tickets affect mechanic difficulty, failures, scoring, or accepted-run
comparability. Before releasing this milestone, explicitly ask whether it
starts a new leaderboard season. Until the user says otherwise, retain
`season-1`.

## M2 · Ranking and achievement integrity — completed

Goal: make every public position, crown, profile, and lifetime achievement
agree before another SemVer release can mix results into the current season.

- `BUG-136` — one best run per account and board.
- `BUG-137` — stable authoritative ranks while searching run boards.
- `BUG-138` — actual phase-clear counts and full-run-only streaks.
- `BUG-139` — issued-configuration validation and idempotent completion retry.
- `BUG-140` — rate-limit attempt issuance.
- `BUG-141` — never expose a linked guild from alias identity.
- `BUG-142` — one current-season scope for public, personal, and profile ranks.
- `BUG-143` — award the missing browser-local flawless Phase 1 achievement.
- `SPEC-016` — retain `season-1` while making rank-one achievement points
  permanent, account-deduplicated, and finite.

Completed under `BUG-136`–`BUG-143` and `SPEC-016`. The repairs retain
`season-1`. Their visible ranking and lifetime-point effects still require the
explicit leaderboard reminder before a release.

## M3 · Developer and test tooling

Goal: make local verification faster without creating production bypasses.

- `FR-051` — remove avoidable runner warnings while retaining real diagnostics.
- `FR-038` — localhost-only `Gnomkaiser` admin mode for completion and
  achievement testing.
- `FR-067` — add a private, rate-limited live bug-report inbox with an audited
  promotion path to GitHub.
- `CR-199` — provide one stable local focused-Playwright wrapper with named
  regression presets and a free-text fallback.

This milestone is not leaderboard-visible. `FR-067` is a production support
surface, but it does not alter encounter or ranking behavior.

## M4 · Easter egg and activity polish

Goal: add optional flavor only after encounter and ranking correctness.

- `FR-039` — live `Gnomkaiser` crown, raid scale treatment, and hidden
  achievement.
- `FR-069` — API-only manually granted exceptional achievements, beginning
  with the hidden 10-point Find a Bug badge and concealed public credentials.
- `FR-066` — clearly fictional live-activity flavor using the prepared copy
  deck after frequency, injection, accessibility, and localization decisions.

`FR-039` changes achievement eligibility and therefore needs a leaderboard
season reminder before release. `FR-066` must remain visibly distinct from
verified player events and must never write fictional records into the API.

## Documentation milestone

`SPEC-015` owns the current specification/inventory/API reconciliation and this
milestone register. It is complete only when:

- the feature inventory matches the shipped trainer;
- the API document matches deployed routes and operations while listing known
  deviations as tickets;
- released Phase 1 tickets no longer claim localhost-only status;
- every open ticket appears in exactly one milestone;
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains the post-v0.6 work under `Unreleased`.
